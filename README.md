        ### INTERACTIVE SHOPPING LIST

# Array: A JavaScript array is used to store the shopping list items

# DOM Manipulation:
    HTML structure includes:
        -An input field for adding items
        -A list container to display items
        -Buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List"
#JavaScript dynamically updates the list container when items are added

# Visual updates for purchased items (e.g. strikethrough text, different background color).

# Event Handling:
    -Event listeners for the "Add" button to capture user input.
    -Event listeners for list items to mark them as purchased.
    -An event listener for the "Clear List" button to remove all items.
